        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Jeremy and I am a 4th year Business and Computer Science Student at UBC. I am familiar with Angular, RxJS, NodeJS,
            HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JS, pertaining to web development. I am excited to learn more about React and backend systems this term.</p>
        <p>I am a soccer fanatic and huge fan of Liverpool FC, soon to be crowned Premier League Champions when the 2020 season resumes. Jurgen Klopp
            is my idol. I have over 30 jerseys and hope to one day attend a Champions League Final Liverpool plays in. </p>
            <p>My favorite television show is <em> Curb Your Enthusiasm</em>, closely followed by <em>Seinfeld</em>. Larry David, much like Jurgen Klopp,
            is one of my idols.</p>

            <h2>About CPSC 436I</h2>
    <p>Hello, this is the first assignment for <a href="https://blogs.ubc.ca/cpsc436i2020s/">CPSC 436I</a> for the 2020S
    term. The course will be fully online, and I am looking forward to a great semester. See an excerpt taken from the course page for a
    description of the course material:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://blogs.ubc.ca/cpsc436i2020s/">
        In this course, students design, implement, and release a project in teams of 2-4 using a suite of related, current, and in-demand technologies.
        Specific technologies will change over time, but a current example would be full-stack web development with technologies including
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, MongoDB, NodeJS, and release engineering systems. These are taught with a “mobile-first” focus and
        via cloud-based technologies like AWS and heroku.
    </blockquote>
        <blockquote cite="https://blogs.ubc.ca/cpsc436i2020s/">
        To deepen the career preparatory experience, the course is primarily taught
        via a series of interactive, hands-on workshops led by industry experts who are ideally departmental alumni, held on alternating weekends.
        Industry experts give a 2 hour interactive introduction to a technology, a 30 minute discussion of their career path and
        guidance for early-career professionals, and support facilitation of a 2 hour hands-on session to work with the technology.</blockquote>
